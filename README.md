# Linux Kernel

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. <br> Please read
<a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst"> Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst </a> first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

### <a href=https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/>https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/</a>

There are various text files in the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation/">Documentation/</a> subdirectory,
several of them using the Restructured Text markup notation.

Please read the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/Documentation/process/changes.rst">Documentation/process/changes.rst</a> file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
